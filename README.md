# Dynamic Pricing Optimization for Retail Fashion

## Problem Description

In the retail fashion market, customers compare products and prices across different brands before making their final purchase decisions. Since pricing strategies have become increasingly crucial, we have decided to develop an information system that helps customers analyze and compare retail prices efficiently.  

With our project, **Dynamic Pricing Optimization for Retail Fashion**, we aim to simplify a detailed dataset, *fashion_boutique_dataset*, which contains 14 variables: product ID, category, brand, season, size, color, original price, markdown percentage, current price, purchase date, stock quantity, customer rating, return status, and return reason. From this dataset, we focus only on five variables: category, brand, season, original price, and purchase date. These variables allow direct comparisons of products, brands, and pricing over time.  

For example, using the system, a user can easily compare the prices of jeans from Zara and H&M, or explore how outerwear prices change across different seasons.  

## Project Goals

The project has two key goals. The first is to serve customers by providing an intuitive tool to filter by product, brand, and season in order to find the best value. The second is to support businesses by delivering insights into competitive pricing and illustrating how seasonal trends influence retail pricing strategies.
